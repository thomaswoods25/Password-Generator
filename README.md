Summary: With the 3rd project, I was able to create a successful password generator containing my html, css design and javascript code. 
I have continued to learn and grow my HTML skill and trying to perfect it. 
My HTML elements are composed of different structures, positions and styles being the baseline to the password generator for the website. 
The CSS design for my website contains the wrapper for the password generator, the button to work the password generator and the card of the finished project to see the password generator being displayed.
Finally to connect everything the hardest part was crafting the JavaScript with the poissible characters to the different variables and functions and arrays.
I have watched numerous youtube videos and zoom recordings on the UNC bootcamp website.
I have reached out to my ASKBCS, TAs during my office hours, my intructor during class hours and my acaedmic advisors to get all the proper knowledge from the resources I am provided. This third project was a great opportunity to continously craft my visual studio coding projects.
